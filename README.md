### Problem statement

**Battling Ransomware and Zero-Day Attacks:**
Creating an AI-powered threat detection system is crucial in fighting ransomware and zero-day attacks. This system monitors network traffic and behaviors, analyzing data to swiftly detect and eliminate emerging threats. Equipped wit h advanced AI algorit hms, it can neutralize attacks in real- time, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers. Constant adaptation and learning ensure proactive defense against evolving threats.

### Dataset description
We use two datasets, `UGRansomeWare` and `CICIDS2017`. The datasets have been used from kaggle
